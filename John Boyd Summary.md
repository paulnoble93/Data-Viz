# How to Graph Badly
**Chartjunk** - Extraneous information and visual flair
 
* Don’t use area where length will suffice 
* Avoid illegible fonts 
* Don’t use too many fonts unless they work well together and serve a purpose 
* Think about scaling and printing
* Shading can be good, but reader bias is to only remember the shaded region of a graphic
* To many shading features become hard to distinguish and reproduce accurately 
* Pseudo 3D effects make judging area even more difficult 
* Color is often expensive, be careful!

**Over-interpretation** - Trying to hard to see something in the data. An example would be trying to place curves in random data. 

**Carpet Bombing** - using simply a lot of graphs is a good way to confuse the reader 
* try highlighting key pints, varying the types of graphs, and sticking to three main points

## Common Obfuscations
1. Changing Scales mid Axis
2. Emphasizing the trivial details 
3. Using different axis ranges on two side by side graphs 
4. Ordering the data by irrelevant criterion 
5. Bad labeling 
6. To many dimensions or decimal places 

**High Data Density** - it is possible to effectively have a lot of diverse data in one graph - you just have to consider all the common mistakes first. 

**Data Hiding** - Adding to many irrelevant features such as a grade when one is not needed 

**Inconsistent Visual Metaphor** - switching the use of shading, grading, or weighting 

**Context Free Data** - If the data is coming from a field that requires more understanding to properly interpret the data, make sure to include the background. Ideally before the graph. 

**Area Instead of Length** - This is always confusing 

**Label Woes**
* Too small to read 
* Poor placement 
* To few labels - confusing 
* To  many labels is also possible if the changes between data points are not what is important 

**Emphasizing the unimportant** - makes the comparison between irrelevant characteristics. For example when measuring GDP it would not be necessary to color the countries differently, that is not important 

**Unnecessary Novelty** - don’t use a design just because you can or you think it is new. If the viewer sees a graph in a way they haven’t in the past it will only take them longer to understand. 

# Gospel according to Tufte
**Data Ink** - non erasable core of a graphic 
**Data Ink Ratio** - data ink/total ink used 

* above all else show the data
	* try writing a summary statement for each graph first 
* maximize data ink ratio 
	* curves are thicker than the axis 
* erase non-data ink 
	* away with the grid -unless the grid is the message 
	* try shading the grid, or dotting 
	* Try half framing graphs by only marking essential axis 
	* Bar graphs with two comparisons don’t ave to have shading or texture - you can achieve the same effect by grouping lines 
	* People want to see symmetry - don’t confuse them 
* erase redundant data ink 
	* Some graphs should really just be tables
* revise and edit 

## High Data Density 
* Data density is good until it becomes hard to understand 
* If there are subsets of data that show there own story - connect these points. 
	* The copper diagram has subsets of data from over 200 tests
	* If a graph has clumps and filaments - try to highlight those they may look different on their own 

**Shrinking** - shrink multiple graphs into one pane if they all tell a story. A good example of this is the New York City weather from chapter one. 
* 	Sometimes not all of the graphs even need labels, just a title or number 

**Multi-functional Graphical Elements** - hard to implement and there isn’t a great rule set for when you should. A cool example from the book was a bar graph that used numbers to fill the bars!

**Animation and Multiples** - Showing multiple graphs that have slightly varied data to give the viewer a better picture 
	* 	Don’t use changing time scales 
	* Don’t space the changes to slowly or two quickly - they should be perceivable at a glance 

**One plus One equal three** - shapes interact to mean and show much more than their simple form 

**Layering** - Bring the important stuff to the front - use bolding - put labels next to what they label - Word labels are superior 

**Pro Tip** - Put time on a spatial coordinate system  - almost always a good time 

**Pro Tip** - use ratios that are common like paper sizes and television ratios. Nobody wants to look at a weird shape. 

## Color
* Don’t use a full box of crayons - rather colors that mean something 
	* Gradient to show values 
	* opposite hues t show differences 
	* positive negative values to show data values moving apart and coming closer 
* Contours can help us see the shapes and data where a simple gradient may be to subtle
